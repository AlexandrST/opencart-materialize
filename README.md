## Differences from standard features OpenCart
The main difference of the template is the use of the [Materialize framework](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize), based on the principles of material design from Google. All the power of the framework has made it possible to achieve a beautiful, intuitive and adaptive design. Provided stunning view and responsiveness of the site both on desktops and on mobile devices. A principled and uncompromising approach with regard to download speed of the site allowed achieving actual fast download speeds and high scores on the sites of the testers.

The template is not limited to moving the work of OpenCart to the Materialize framework. A huge amount of standard functionality was processed. Integrated many unique technical solutions, many useful modules for convenient e-Commerce.

Due to the large number of changes, in order to support multilingual, some components require translation. By default, the template supports the following languages: English, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Romanian.
